🏏 IPL Data Analysis & Winner Prediction | 📜 Research Article Summarization


This repository contains two machine learning and data science projects:

1.IPL Data Analysis & Winner Prediction – A statistical and ML-based approach to analyze past IPL performance and predict the winner of IPL 2025.

2.Research Article Summarization – An NLP-driven project that automates summarization of research articles using extractive and abstractive techniques.

Project 1: IPL Data Analysis & Winner Prediction


Objective : The goal is to analyze historical IPL data, extract key performance indicators, and apply machine learning techniques to predict the likely winner of IPL 2025.


Features


✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing of IPL datasets

✔ Player and team performance analysis using statistics

✔ Implementation of ML models for winner prediction

✔ Visualization of key trends in IPL history
